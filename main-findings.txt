The main findings:

1. Companies will pay you even if you do not showcase their products, as long as you match their style or in some other way reinforce brand awareness.

2. Bringing the influencer to life by posting daily Instagram stories makes her appear more real and is also useful for marketing purposes.

3. Having the influencer actually use real products is the next step â€“ this can directly assist with product awareness, which may be particularly beneficial for smaller companies since usually, only the big players can afford brand awareness campaigns.
